# Publish Director - Cinematic Pipeline

## When To Use

Package the cinematic piece and any cutdowns so the hero version stays clear and the distribution intent is obvious.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["compose"]["render_report"]`, `state.artifacts["proposal"]["proposal_packet"]`, `state.artifacts["research"]["research_brief"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Final outputs and beat map |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Tone and naming consistency |

## Process

### 1. Separate Hero And Derivatives

Typical deliverables:

- hero trailer or brand film,
- teaser cut,
- social cutdown,
- poster-frame or thumbnail concept.

### 2. Match Metadata To Tone

Packaging should reflect the actual mood:

- dramatic,
- premium,
- mysterious,
- reflective,
- urgent.

### 3. Preserve Editorial Truth

Store in `publish_log.metadata`:

- `hero_output`
- `derivative_outputs`
- `poster_frame_notes`
- `distribution_notes`

### 4. Quality Gate

- hero export is clearly identified,
- derivative exports are labeled by purpose,
- metadata fits the tone,
- the package is usable without manual cleanup.

## Common Pitfalls

- Mixing teaser and hero outputs without clear naming.
- Writing generic metadata that ignores the mood.
- Treating all cutdowns as interchangeable.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## TikTok Direct Post (tiktok_publisher)

When the brief targets TikTok and `tiktok_publisher` is AVAILABLE in the registry:

1. Call `creator_info` first (the tool does this internally, but for the approval gate run it via the tool's client or a dry run) and present the REAL `privacy_level_options` to the user. Never assume `PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE` — unaudited TikTok apps can only post `SELF_ONLY` / friends / followers.
2. At the publish checkpoint present: the final video path, the exact caption (`title`, hashtags inline, ≤2200 chars), and the privacy level choice. Wait for approval — this gate is `human_approval_default: true`.
3. Log the decision in `decision_log` (`category: "publish_target"`, subject: "TikTok direct post") with privacy level and caption.
4. After approval call `tiktok_publisher` with `video_path`, `title`, `privacy_level`. The tool always labels the post as AI-generated content (`is_aigc`).
5. Merge the returned `publish_log` entries with any `export_bundle` entries into the stage's canonical `publish_log` artifact.
6. Mind the platform caps: ~15 posts/day per creator, 6 API requests/min — relevant for clip-factory batch runs.

If the tool is UNAVAILABLE, offer the setup path from its `install_instructions` (env keys + `python3 scripts/tiktok_login.py`) instead of silently exporting only.
