# Publish Director - Localization Dub Pipeline

## When To Use

Package the completed localization outputs so downstream teams can find the right video, subtitle, and metadata bundle for each language without manual cleanup.

## Process

### 1. Package By Locale

Each language package should clearly separate:

- video output,
- subtitle files,
- transcript or approved script copy,
- review notes,
- metadata.

### 2. Keep Naming Precise

Recommended metadata keys:

- `locale`
- `language_name`
- `deliverable_mode`
- `subtitle_included`
- `review_owner`

### 3. Preserve Review Context

If a language output has pronunciation caveats, timing warnings, or missing lip sync, keep that note in the published package.

### 4. Quality Gate

- locale packages are clearly labeled,
- metadata matches the actual treatment,
- supporting text assets are present,
- warnings and review notes are not lost.

## Common Pitfalls

- Shipping localized videos without the matching subtitle or transcript files.
- Mixing audio-dub and subtitle-only variants under the same generic filename.
- Removing the QA notes that explain known issues.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## TikTok Direct Post (tiktok_publisher)

When the brief targets TikTok and `tiktok_publisher` is AVAILABLE in the registry:

1. Call `creator_info` first (the tool does this internally, but for the approval gate run it via the tool's client or a dry run) and present the REAL `privacy_level_options` to the user. Never assume `PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE` — unaudited TikTok apps can only post `SELF_ONLY` / friends / followers.
2. At the publish checkpoint present: the final video path, the exact caption (`title`, hashtags inline, ≤2200 chars), and the privacy level choice. Wait for approval — this gate is `human_approval_default: true`.
3. Log the decision in `decision_log` (`category: "publish_target"`, subject: "TikTok direct post") with privacy level and caption.
4. After approval call `tiktok_publisher` with `video_path`, `title`, `privacy_level`. The tool always labels the post as AI-generated content (`is_aigc`).
5. Merge the returned `publish_log` entries with any `export_bundle` entries into the stage's canonical `publish_log` artifact.
6. Mind the platform caps: ~15 posts/day per creator, 6 API requests/min — relevant for clip-factory batch runs.

If the tool is UNAVAILABLE, offer the setup path from its `install_instructions` (env keys + `python3 scripts/tiktok_login.py`) instead of silently exporting only.
