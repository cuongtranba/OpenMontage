# Publish Director — Talking Head Pipeline

## When to Use

You have a render report with the final video. Your job is to prepare metadata, thumbnails, and an export package for publishing.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | Render report, Brief | Video file and context |

## Process

### Step 1: Generate Metadata

Create platform-specific metadata:
- **Title**: Based on the brief's title and hook
- **Description**: Summary of the content with relevant keywords
- **Tags**: Derived from brief's key_points
- **Chapters**: From script section timestamps

### Step 2: Thumbnail Concept

Describe or generate a thumbnail:
- Extract a compelling frame from the footage (if frame_sampler available)
- Add text overlay concept (title or key stat)

### Step 3: Package Export

Create the export directory:
- Video file
- Metadata JSON
- Description text file
- Chapter markers
- Thumbnail concept

### Step 4: Build Publish Log

Document the publish event with platform, status (draft), and export path.

### Step 5: Self-Evaluate

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Metadata quality** | Is the title compelling and description informative? |
| **Completeness** | Is the export package complete? |

### Step 6: Submit

Validate the publish_log against the schema and persist via checkpoint.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## TikTok Direct Post (tiktok_publisher)

When the brief targets TikTok and `tiktok_publisher` is AVAILABLE in the registry:

1. Call `creator_info` first (the tool does this internally, but for the approval gate run it via the tool's client or a dry run) and present the REAL `privacy_level_options` to the user. Never assume `PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE` — unaudited TikTok apps can only post `SELF_ONLY` / friends / followers.
2. At the publish checkpoint present: the final video path, the exact caption (`title`, hashtags inline, ≤2200 chars), and the privacy level choice. Wait for approval — this gate is `human_approval_default: true`.
3. Log the decision in `decision_log` (`category: "publish_target"`, subject: "TikTok direct post") with privacy level and caption.
4. After approval call `tiktok_publisher` with `video_path`, `title`, `privacy_level`. The tool always labels the post as AI-generated content (`is_aigc`).
5. Merge the returned `publish_log` entries with any `export_bundle` entries into the stage's canonical `publish_log` artifact.
6. Mind the platform caps: ~15 posts/day per creator, 6 API requests/min — relevant for clip-factory batch runs.

If the tool is UNAVAILABLE, offer the setup path from its `install_instructions` (env keys + `python3 scripts/tiktok_login.py`) instead of silently exporting only.
